We always declare class member access modifiers.

We use let or const instead of var. 

We use const if a variable is never reassigned.

We import babylon.js core classes from "@babylonjs/core"

We don't use explicit type declarations for variables or parameters initialized to a number, string, or boolean.

Don't delete comments when editing existing code.
